There is only one issue, the drop-down menu acts a little weird, but I don't even know if we are going to use the bootstrap drop-down or if just use the simple wordpress one.  I also just did overwrites with the same name class from the bootstrap css,which isn't the best practice, i did that so we can decide if we just want to edit bootstrap.css or create more custom classes ( which my make it slower to load).  Vi i strongly recommend you use my files  when integrating,because yours had quite a bit of errors in the index.html file. And Micheal remember how we decided for me to do the navigation in two different ways (one with the separation with color of the 6 menus,and one with just a shade of gray for all of them) with the way i made it , a simple css change and both ways can be access.

Templates done with minimal coding (class/ids). I named them accordingly. I kept the code short as possible because i dont know exactly how each div is going to be intergrated. I can easily change anything though so feel free to ask.  Waiting for further details to complete template.  Also send me any more mock ups you need me to design.
